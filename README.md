# EyeRolling-Demo
EyeRolling is 3D runner game made in Unity using C#

Since this is my first Unity project I didn't put much work in making this game look pretty, I just wanted to make it playable and learn C#. Android version coming soon!

Since I'm not the greatest artist, Eye model is downloaded from this [page](https://free3d.com/3d-model/eyeball--33237.html). Made by user "3dhaupt", thanks!

Your goal is to dodge obstacles and pass levels.
Use WASD or Arrows to move and SPACE to jump.

You can play it for free [here](https://djordjemancic97.itch.io/eyerolling).
